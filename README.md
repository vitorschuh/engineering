# engineering ⚙️
repo to archive my academic eng projects (nothing very useful if you aren't a eletrical or eletronic eng student)

## context
the repository folders contain projects developed in the undergrad courses of design of integrated circuits, systems and signals, communication systems and control systems

## teorical requirements
the projects on this repo requires an understanding of engineering maths (mainly differential equations and Laplace, Fourier and Z transforms), an understanding of the behavior of time-invariant linear systems, an understanding of the electrical signals used in the design of open and closed-loop systems (such u(t), δ(t) and others along w/ their frequency counterparts in s, z and jω domains) and a basic notion how to interpret graphical system analysis features (such as Bode, Nyquist and eye diagrams)

## tools
- MATLAB
- LTSpice
- MicroCap
- MicroWind

feel free to use my projects to help build your knowledge 🤙🏻
