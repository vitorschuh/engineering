# engineering ⚙️
repo to archive my academic eng projects (nothing very useful if you aren't a eletrical or eletronic eng student)

## context
the repository folders contain projects developed in the undergraduate courses of design of integrated circuits, systems and signals, communication systems and control systems

## teorical requirements
the projects require an understanding of engineering mathematics (mainly differential equations and Laplace and Fourier transforms), an understanding of basic signals used in the design of electrical systems (such as step, impulse and ramp along with their frequency counterparts) and a basic understanding of visualization of system diagrams (such as Bode diagrams, Nyquist diagrams and eye diagrams)

## tools
- MATLAB
- LTSpice
- MicroWind

feel free to use my projects to help build your knowledge 🤙🏻
